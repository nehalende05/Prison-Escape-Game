Prison Escape – Console Game in C


Prison Escape is a menu-driven console game developed using C programming language. The game places the player in a fictional prison scenario where they must make a series of logical decisions to successfully escape. Each stage presents a situation with multiple choices, but only one correct choice allows the player to proceed further. A wrong decision immediately ends the game with a “GAME OVER” message, making decision-making and logic the core focus of the project.
The game starts with the player waking up inside a prison. As the story progresses, the player encounters different situations such as dealing with guards, escaping locked cells, disabling CCTV cameras, navigating corridors, handling a police dog, and finally reaching the exit gate. The game progresses linearly and concludes either with a successful escape or failure based on the user’s choices.
